# 🌌 CSS Solar System Simulation

A visually engaging, interactive solar system simulation built entirely with **pure HTML and CSS**. This project explores the power of CSS animations and custom properties to create a responsive, 3D-like experience without any JavaScript.

## ✨ Features
- **Realistic Orbits:** Each planet has a unique orbital speed and distance from the Sun.
- **Counter-Rotation Logic:** Planet labels stay upright while the planets orbit, achieved through a "forward-backward" rotation animation trick.
- **Responsive Design:** The entire system scales dynamically using CSS `transform` and media queries to look great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Pure CSS:** Zero JavaScript used—demonstrating the advanced capabilities of modern CSS.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure for the orbits and planetary bodies.
- **CSS3:** - `@keyframes` for orbital mechanics.
  - **CSS Variables (`--distance`)** for clean, maintainable code.
  - **Flexbox & Absolute Positioning** for precise layout and layering.
  - **Radial Gradients** for realistic space and planetary lighting.

## 💡 What I Learned
As my first web development project, this was a deep dive into:
- Mastering the **CSS Box Model** and absolute positioning.
- Understanding how to use **CSS Custom Properties** to keep code "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Solving complex animation challenges, like the counter-rotation of text elements.
